# Machine-Learning


a complete project that involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and tuning using a popular dataset.

 Here's an outline of what I did:

# Load and preprocess the data
# Perform feature engineering
# Train and evaluate a machine learning model
# Tune the model's hyperparameters
# Evaluate the final model

I used Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost.

This code covers loading and preprocessing the data, performing feature engineering, training a machine learning model, tuning the model's hyperparameters, and evaluating the final model. You can expand on this by adding more feature engineering steps, trying different models, or using advanced techniques like cross-validation and ensembling.
